What is a branch ?

Branch is a kind of backup for original repo (master branch)
by default the rep which we create is a master branch 

git branch <branch name>

git branch -a this will show all the branches in your repo

  master
* spalsh-backup --> this the branch we are on 
  splash-100

To go to the splash-backup branch 
git checkout <branch name>
ie git checkout splash-backup
